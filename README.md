# advanced example to show case TinyScheduler Library

architecture

- Two players (client and server)
- server serves a page with a status that randomly changes at certain intervals
- client periodically pulls down the page to check for status changes and if it notices a status change it outputs the status else outputs a "nothing found yadada" line


### Edits

Couldn't include Twilio because the twilio library has some weird tight constraints
