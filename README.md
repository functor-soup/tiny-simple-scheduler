# advanced example to show case TinyScheduler Library

architecture

- Two players (client and server)
- server serves a page with a status that randomly changes at certain intervals
- client periodically pulls down the page to check for status changes and if it notices a status change it sends a sms via twilio


### why is the example a little too involved with other libraries?

I like playing around with code a lot .. sue me
